Students in the Master of Counselling course are exposed to a range of theories and encouraged to develop a holistic approach to counselling based on the understanding that the human person is an integrated being and that no one approach to counselling has all the answers or is the right approach for every client. In the master of counselling course, you will develop an intentionally integrated understanding of the human person, the basis of human difficulties, and processes of change, growth and healing. During the master of counselling course, you will learn to implement a process that holds the potential to mobilise change for clients. Built on trauma-informed principles, this process-based approach of the master of counselling course then becomes the basis of theoretical integration. There is a strong emphasis on developing the personality of the counsellor. This includes valuing the well-being of the counsellor. CHC’s master of counselling course is designed to equip student counsellors with the knowledge, skills and experience necessary to work ethically, sensitively, inclusively and respectfully with clients from diverse backgrounds As a ‘first training’ course, the Master of Counselling is not available to students who already hold a PACFA-accredited qualification, such as a Bachelor of Counselling. Successful engagement in the Counselling profession requires a level of personal maturity and self-awareness. PACFA (Psychotherapy and Counselling Federation of Australia) therefore recommends that current and prospective Masters in counselling students are assessed for their personal growth and likely suitability for the Counselling profession. Entry to the Master of Counselling is thus subject not only to academic requirements but also personal suitability as assessed through an interview, a personal statement and referee reports."
