Applied neuroscience is a multidisciplinary perspective drawn from the fields of human biology, psychology, education, and psychotherapy, enhancing the practice of professionals working with people. By integrating the findings of the relatively young discipline of neuroscience with the more traditional emotional, cognitive, behavioural, developmental, and social knowledge of psychology, neuropsychotherapy provides a framework for understanding the human condition from a holistic perspective. Neuropsychotherapy strives to shift the brain into a state that enables these basic needs to be fully satisfied and resulting in best possible outcomes in people’s lives by engaging the brain through implicit memory rather than relying purely on language and explicit memory.","Applied neuroscience has the potential to transform professional practice in a wide range of disciplines such as psychology, medicine, psychiatry, counselling, education, human resource management, social work and nursing. The Graduate Certificate in Applied Neuroscience was formerly known as the Graduate Certificate in Neuropsychotherapy (SS33).",Australia,no,yes,no,yes,yes,
